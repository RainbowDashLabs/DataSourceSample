## DataSourceSample
 
This repository provides example implementations to work with data pools in combination with [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP). \
The examples are not considered as a best practise and are not designed to be copy pasted to other code, but can be used as a reference for own implementations of HikariCP.

Current examples are present for
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
